# Toolkit-for-Displacement-Hysteresis-Visualization
  Hysterisis data manipulation and visualization toolkit is an effort to develop programs to represent the data intuitively. A side project is to train artificial neural networks to predict the plot for arbitrary loads, displacement or cycle within data range.
  
# Possible Visulization Methods being Implemented:
## Simple Plots
